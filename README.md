## FAQs

1. Is there any cost associated with hosting a page on GitHub?
    - GitHub offers free hosting for static websites through GitHub Pages. To learn more about Github pages, please go [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)

2. What is the difference between hosting a index.html and index.md file?
    - They are essentially the same when it comes to hosting a page on Github. The main different is that you can choose to implement html code in index.md if you want to further customize your page. However, that would require you to know html. It would be more convenient to use Jekyll to apply theme.

3. Can I not use Visual Studio Code and code write directly on Github repository?
    - Yes, you can. However, it takes a lot of time for Github to commit and redeploy everytime you make changes. It would be best if you do it locally on Visual Studio Code or any types of text editor you are familiar with.
